RabbitMQ Concepts:
  Exchanges:
    It is an abstraction that receives messages from the producer and delivers messages to the Queues in the broker.
    Message routing agents.
    Is is responsible for routing messages to different Queues with the help of header attributes, Bindings and Routing Keys.
    Exchange Types:
      Direct:
        Uses the routing key
        The message goes to the queue where the Binding key matches the Routing Key
      Topic:
        Uses patterns to match the routing key to the binding key of the queue
        if the routing key matches the pattern of a queue, it is enqueued
      Fanout:
        routing key is ignored
        exchange broadcasts the message to all the queues
      Headers:
        routing key is ignored
        the queue is matched with the header properties of the message 
  Bindings:
    It is a link where queue is binding to the exchange
  Routing Keys:
    A message attribute, which exchange looks to route the message to a queue
    Depending on the exchange type a routing key can be ignored

MassTransit:
    3 ways of sending Message:
      1. IRequestClient - Request/Response pattern
      2. IPublishEndpoint - Pub/Sub pattern - to Exchange or Topic, for events and messages
      3. ISendEndpointProvider - to specific endpoints, for messages and commands
